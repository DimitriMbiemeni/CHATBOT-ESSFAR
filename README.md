# How to install it !

After getting the whole directory on your computer, there are prerequisites before it works!

1- Make sure you've got python installed on your computer. You can run the following command to know which version of python you have:`python --version`.

2- Depending on the version of python you have, make sure your pip is well installed. Use the fo;;owing command to do so: `pip --version`.

3- If you do not have python, you can refer to: `https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/`, and download python. A version between 3.6 and 3.7 is preferred.

4- There after you need to install the appropriate pip version for your python. You can do so at: `https://pypi.org/project/pip/`.

5- The last thing to do is installing a set of packages we are going to be using. The packages are `Django`, `pyyaml`, `chatterbot`, `spacy`, `chatterbot-corpus`.

6- Then you move to your working directory where you havee saved the project from your Command Prompt and run `python manage.py runserver`; If everything works correctly you will get a http address.
